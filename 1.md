FUNCTIONAL & CX OBJECTIVES
Deliver Sustainable Financial Performance.
Development effort is reduced by 25% as compared to 2023.
To achieve this, I was following the strategies below:
1. Process optimization. I suggested management team to create JIRA project DPMDUP and start working using agile methodology. Now developers can attach theirs work to somewhere and everybody can see development process and team collaboration which increased efficiency.
2. Automation.  
I automated CI/CD for three projects related to DEH migration, supporting DevOps team with writing them, helping with integrating them with SonarCloud and Artifactory, which reduced manual efforts. Also, we introduced additional steps for automating testing which minimized the time spent on manual testing.
3. Tools and Technologies.
I migrated 5 java projects from java 8 to java 21, this adoption allowed us to enhance productivity and reduced development time. fix
4. Skill Development.
Held one learning session for the Java Backend Team when I was talking about “Clean Code” practices. Then, in the project we started using the practices. This enabled us to work more efficiently and reduced number of code conflicts.
5. Project Management.
Regarding to more effective planning, introduced such practice when developer is preparing for the next spring adding tasks to backlog. This reduced time spent on rework due to misunderstandings or incomplete information.
6. Outsourcing
Considered outsourcing non-core activities to third-party vendors to focus on key development tasks. This activity reduced development efforts.
Drive Strategic Transformation in our business for long term growth.
- Digital Banking testing is 90% automated - Proactive alerts are generated 80% of the time for failures 
- 40% of all Java applications are moved to AWS releasing infrastructure from on-premise data center
Moved 100% of planned java applications to AWS using a three phases (Dev without IaC, Dev with IaC and Sit). Made them ready on Dev and Sit environments and enhanced monitoring and logging mechanisms to capture system performance and failures. These projects were migrated according to Design architecture and within migration plan and timeline. 

Highest Standard for Corporate Governance, compliance and risk management.
- No risk exemption requests are raised 
- 100% of mandatory trainings are completed before time & without reminder 
- No high risk or audit issues is overdue 
- No high risk or audit issue is reopened
Adhered to risk policies, regular trainings, and proactive risk management.
Become a magnet for attracting & retaining top talent.
- Refer at least 5 candidates to the bank with different nationality than yours - 4 internal and 4 external awards are won.
Conducted 4 interviews and refer three candidate for different positions with relevant experience from three different countries.
Deliver top quality customer experience.
- 4 customer journeys are digitized per quarter 
- Microservices based architecture is delivered for key initiatives such as CLM
- DEH with 80% of unit test code coverage 
- 4 legacy applications are consolidated into 1 & deployed to cloud 
- Defect density is below 10% 
- Defect leakage is below 5% 
- Mean time to triage (MTTT) is reduced by 25% as compared to 2023 
- Observability dashboard is available for every release 
- Every release has a feed into data platform - Average defect aging is below 10 days
Delivered for key initiatives such as DEH migration. DEH achieved 80% of unit test code coverage. 3 legacy applications consolidated into 3 and deployed to cloud with upgraded platforms. Defect leakage is below 5%. Only 3 but tasks were created during DEH migration. Prepared DBs to feed data into data platform deploying them into cloud.

BEHAVIORAL OBJECTIVES
Integrity Fosters Transparency
We behave ethically and do the right thing, even when no one is watching Do I ensure information and updates are shared on time with everyone? Do I demonstrate being reliable and dependable?
When a critical project update with challenging feedback was due, I communicated it honestly and promptly to the team, addressing concerns and providing support. This helped to the trust and demonstrated my commitment to ethical behavior and transparency.
Accountability
We own it, accept responsibility and deliver on our commitments. Do I take responsibility and accountability for actions, good and bad? Do I monitor and address my performance gaps proactively? Do I work towards doing what I say, saying what I do?
When a project faced unexpected challenges, I took full responsibility, and addressed the issues head-on, and implemented corrective actions. I regularly reviewed my performance and worked to bridge any gaps, ensuring delivered on my promises.
Collaboration
We work together towards quality outcomes for all stakeholders Do I support team members to elevate their performance? Do I build relationships within/outside organization? Do I ensure right information is shared at the right time? Do I promote/nurture a culture of partnership?
I consistently supported team members by providing guidance and resources to help them improve their performance. I actively facilitated collaboration on projects. Overall, I promoted a culture where partnership and collaboration were valued and encouraged among all team members.
Exceed Customer Expectations
We continuously create maximum value for all our customers Do I take customer feedback with courtesy, and professionalism? Do I listen to understand the unsaid or unmet needs of the customer? Do I contribute ideas to improve the quality, or speed of delivering service? Do I visibly endorse ‘a customer first’ value?
I consistently handled line manager’s and other team members feedback with empathy and professionalism, ensuring their need were met promptly.
